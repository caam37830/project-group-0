    "## 1. Introduction to the SIR model\n",
    "The SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) model, contributed by Kermack, W. O., McKendrick, A. G, Ronald Ross and others, was formed in the early twenties and made a big breakthrough in modeling the trend of the possibile disease outbreak as well as providing key information for the public and authorities regarding severeness and control [[1]](#1). The establishment of the simiplied model is implemented here in this project [[2]](#1)[[3]](#1)[[4]](#1). \n",
    "\n",
    "Under a fixed homogeneous population (`N`), three distinct subpopulations are divided (`S` + `I` + `R` = `N`): \n",
    "1. `S`  - those who are susceptible and have not yet caught the disease\n",
    "2. `I`  - those who are infected and may spread the disease\n",
    "3. `R`  - those who have recovered without the ability to spread and are immuned to the disease \n",
    "\n",
    "These groups are divided in a way that during an epidemic, people are interested in the amount of infected patients that can transmit the disease, the number of agents who are immuned against the disease and the portions who are not yet being infected and are susceptible. Denote the sizes of these groups at time $t$ by $S(t)$, $I(t)$, and $R(t)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, introduce notations involved in this model: \n",
    "* `b`: a fixed number of interactions that spread the disease per day per infected individual\n",
    "* `k`: a fixed fraction of the infected subpopulation that recovers per day\n",
    "\n",
    "Altogether, the SIR model consists of a system of three ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that be written by\n",
    "$$\\frac{ds}{dt} = -b*s(t)*i(t)$$\n",
    "$$\\frac{di}{dt} = b*s(t)*i(t)-k*i(t)$$\n",
    "$$\\frac{dr}{dt} = k*i(t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where `s`,`i` and `r` here are the percentage of each group size over the total population. \n",
    "\n",
    "Besides a closed population with no social structure, the SIR model also assumes that `R` subpopulation is permanently immuned and the `I` subpopulation is contagious at the moment of infection. Moreover, the model assumes a mass-action mixing, meaning the fraction of interactions between `S` and `I` is proportional to the product of their population sizes [[5]](#1). In other words, each agent will have equal probability in interacting with every other agents per unit time. This implies that an increase in the size of the subpopulations will lead to an increase in the infections and that `I` and `S` are homogeneously distributed in space. This might be problematic in real-world cases, as people tends to encounter within a small community. While these assumptions can sometimes be strong and adversely affecting the prediction in applications, they can be adjusted in various forms to bring complexity and create extended and modified versions of the SIR models. The project explores some variation and modification in section 4."

    "### Modeling the use of quarantine\n",
    "\n",
    "The SIR model assumes the frequency of interaction between one and the other is kept stable even when one of them is infected. According to actual situation, we can see that many countries/regions try to use quarantine to reduce the interactions between people, which is the parameter `b` in the SIR model.  Moreover, under the case of COVID-19, there's a time delay between one being infection and being confirmed as sick. Therefore isolating infected patients is an effective way to reduce the rate of disease transmission. Based on this idea, we propose the following SUQC[[10]](#1) model to describe this situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this model, the total population `N` is divided into 4 parts:\n",
    "1. `S` (Susceptible) - the individual who has not yet caught the disease\n",
    "2. `U` (Unquarantined) - the unquarantined infected individual who may spread the disese to susceptible individuals\n",

    "\n",
    "In the SIR model, `R` subpopulations contains those who have recovered or have died. The real-world case can be a bit more complicated. In previous studies, researchers have found that it seemed important to separate the infectious and the recovering phase [[6]](#1). From a biological point of view, an infectious period might average out about 4 to 5 days while resolving period average out about 14 to 20 days [[7]](#1). Hence, it can be problematic when fitting real-world data on the SIR model. The introduction of the SIRD model helps distinguish the two states. After infection, a person then comes to the 'Resolving' state with two consequences: either recovered or died. The SIRD model clarifies the transmission process and help explore the fatality in evaluating the severeness of the disease. \n",

    "In this model, the total population `N` is divided into 5 groups [[6]](#1):\n",
    "1. S(t) - the number of individuals susceptible\n",

    "3. R(t) - the number of individuals that are being resolved \n",
    "4. D(t) - the number of individuals that died from the disease\n",

    "* $\\gamma$: a Poisson rate of infectiousness resolves\n",
    "* $\\theta$: a fixed fraction of people exiting the resolving state\n",
    "* $\\delta$: a fixed fraction of the resolved consequences being died per day\n",

This situation can be modelled by permorming modifications of the SIR model.\n",

People who recovered is susceptible of the new strain. Here we suppose the number of people died is proprotional to size of infecious population of constant `d`. \n",
