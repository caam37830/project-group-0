# Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) Disease Spread Model Simulations and Variations

## STAT 37830 Project - Group 0

### Authors: Yu An, Frieda Han, Yun Lin

### Abstract

The project investigates a brief introduction of the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) Model and implements it through agent-based, ODE continuous and spacial simulation, indicating that this model can be quite useful in contagion studies. By reviewing a few existing literature, some extensions as well as variations under the SIR model are explored, which includes considering the effect of quarantine, estimating a time-varying parameter, and introducing a new strain.

Keywords: SIR Model, disease spread, infectious disease, contagion modeling
